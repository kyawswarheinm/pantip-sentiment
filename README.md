# Pantip SET Sentiment Monitor

Thai retail investor discussion on [Pantip.com](https://pantip.com) — Thailand's largest public web forum — mined and scored for sentiment against SET-listed stocks. The pipeline scrapes threads, links them to tickers, runs a multilingual transformer (XLM-RoBERTa), and surfaces the results in a live Streamlit dashboard updated every 3 hours. Built entirely on free-tier infrastructure.

Visit [Pantip Sentiment Streamlit App](https://pantip-sentiment.streamlit.app/). The dashboard's **📚 Documentation & Analysis** tab covers how the pipeline works, live-computed analysis charts, key findings, and known limitations — that's the primary reference for methodology and results.

## Quick start

The production database is not publicly shared. There are two ways to work with this project:

### Option A — Explore the data (no credentials needed)

The full scored-posts dataset is published on Kaggle as a CSV. Download it and explore directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kyawswarheinm/pantip-sentiment.git
cd pantip-sentiment
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyawswarheinm/pantip-set-sentiment
# CSV columns: post_id, title_th, url, replies, posted_at,
#              ticker, match_confidence, match_method,
#              sentiment, confidence, label, scored_at
```

From there you can load it into pandas, a Jupyter notebook, or any SQLite-compatible tool for your own analysis.

### Option B — Run the full pipeline (own infrastructure)

To run the scraper, NLP pipeline, and dashboard against your own database:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kyawswarheinm/pantip-sentiment.git
cd pantip-sentiment
pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env
# Set TURSO_URL + TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN for a cloud DB (free at turso.tech),
# or leave both unset to fall back to a local SQLite file at data/local_dev.db

python -m scraper.set_tickers    # seed ticker list
python -m scraper.pantip          # scrape Pantip (requires Chrome)
python -m nlp.inference           # entity match + sentiment score
python -m alerts.spike_detector   # check alerts
python -m backtest.correlation    # fetch prices + run lag-correlation
streamlit run dashboard/app.py    # launch dashboard
```

## Architecture

| Layer | Platform | Free limit | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cron / backend | GitHub Actions | 2,000 min/month | Scrape → entity-link → NLP → alerts → backtest → Kaggle export |
| Database | Turso (LibSQL) | 500 MB, 1B reads/month | Cloud SQLite, accessed via HTTP |
| Frontend | Streamlit Community Cloud | Unlimited public apps | Live dashboard |
| Price data | yfinance | Free | SET ticker OHLCV for lag-correlation backtest |
| Data publishing | Kaggle Datasets | 20 GB | Scored-posts CSV, refreshed every 3 hours |

The active workflow (`scrape.yml`) runs the full chain end-to-end every 3 hours. A second workflow (`kaggle_export.yml`) exists as a standalone export trigger, useful for testing the Kaggle step in isolation.

## Problems encountered & How they were solved

Some brain-itching issues were found while building this — kept a log here in case it saves someone else the debugging time.

### While Scraping Reply Counts

- **Pantip's reply counts are loaded by JavaScript — they don't exist in the raw HTML.** The page uses a JsRender template (`{{:count}} ความคิดเห็น`) that only gets filled in after an AJAX call. `requests` + BeautifulSoup only see the empty placeholder. The original HTML parser (`_parse_stats`, later renamed `_parse_replies`) returned 0 for almost every post because of this.

- **Tracked down the real reply counts endpoint — and it kept getting harder to call.** The actual count lives at `GET /forum/topic/render_comments?tid={id}`, found by reading Pantip's own `jquery.topic-renovate.js` in the browser devtools. It only responds if you include `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` and a `Referer` header — otherwise it returns empty HTML with no error. 

- Pantip later added another requirement: you need a live PHP session (`PHPSESSID` + `rlr` cookies), which only gets set if you visit the homepage and then the topic page in the same `requests.Session()`. The backfill scripts now do this warm-up step before calling the reply counts endpoint.

### While Scraping View Counts 

- **The `views` field was always broken and got removed.** Same root cause as above — view counts(originally meant for engagement analysis) are JS-rendered. Unlike the reply counts, there was no easy API equivalent. `views` was eventually dropped entirely from the schema, scraper, all queries, and the dashboard. This included running `ALTER TABLE … DROP COLUMN` directly on the production database.

### While Parsing Post Timestamps

- **Some posts have a `NULL posted_at`, so the dashboard filters on `scored_at` instead.** Pantip spreads timestamps across JSON-LD, Open Graph tags, `<time>` elements, and `data-utime` attributes — none are guaranteed to be present. When all strategies fail, `posted_at` stays NULL. We use `scored_at` to keep those posts visible in date-range filters, at the cost of answering "what was scored in this window" rather than "what was posted then."

### Bootstrapping the Dataset with Backfill

- **The live scraper only captures what's trending right now — not significant for a correlation study that requires more data.** Pantip's tag pages only surface recent activity, so the pipeline would take months to accumulate enough posts on its own. A one-time backfill (`scripts/backfill.py`) scrolled the same five boards 30× deeper than a normal run, pulling ~2,500 posts back to September 2025 in a single pass. The caveat: only 3 posts predate 2025 — old evergreen threads that resurfaced in a listing — so it's a denser recent slice, not a true historical archive.

---

## Limitations

- **The data is mostly from 2025 onward — it's not a long historical record.** Only 3 of 2,542 scraped posts are from before 2025. Don't treat this as multi-year historical data without checking that your target date range has enough coverage.
- **The dashboard date filter uses `scored_at`, not `posted_at`.** Some posts have a NULL `posted_at` because Pantip's SSR datetime parser occasionally fails. To avoid excluding those posts, the date filter uses `scored_at` — so it answers "what was scored in this window," not "what was posted then."
- **The Thai company alias dictionary only covers ~50 names.** Tickers outside that list fall back to exact-symbol or fuzzy matching with no alias safety net.
- **There's no human-labeled data to verify accuracy against.** Sentiment scores come from `cardiffnlp/twitter-xlm-roberta-base-sentiment` — a general-purpose multilingual model not fine-tuned on Thai financial text. There is no ground-truth Thai financial sentiment dataset to validate it with.
